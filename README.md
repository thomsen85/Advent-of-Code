# My Advent of Code Solutions

All Solutions are my own.
The target is to solve everyone in Rust. Clean solutions are not prioritized, but some are rewritten afterward for the fun of it.

My first year was 2022, I completed about half before exams caught up with me.
2023 was the first year I finished them all.

**2024's goal is to achive top 1000 global rank on some days with Rust.**
_Top until now is 2500th place_

The project is structured mainly by year.
The `aoc` folder is a script I made to create a new day from a template, create tests from the clipboard, fetch the input, and automatically run the tests and the program.
The `common` folder contains functions and structs commonly used to solve problems.
