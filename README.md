# My Advent of Code Solutions

All Solutions are my own.
The target is to solve everyone in rust. Clean solutions are not prioritized, but some are rewritten afterwars for the fun of it.

My first year was 2022, i completed about half before exams caught up with me.
2023 was the first year i finished them all.

**2024s goal is to reach a high global ranking with rust.**

Project is structured by year.
The aoc folder is a script i made to automaticly create a new day from a template, create tests from the clipboard, fetch the input, and automaticly run the tests and the program.
The common folder is some functions and structs commonly used to solve problems.
