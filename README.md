# My Advent of Code Solutions

All Solutions are my own.
The target is to solve everyone in Rust. Clean solutions are not prioritized, but some are rewritten afterward for the fun of it.

My first year was 2022, I completed about half before exams caught up with me.
2023 was the first year I finished them all.

**2024's goal was to achive top 1000 global rank on at least one day with Rust.**

**Day 16 was the first day i got sub 1000th, where i got rank 995 on part 2**
_Top time for 2024 until now is 1158th place for part 1 (Day 13) and 995th place for part 2 (Day 16)._

The project is structured mainly by year.
The `aoc` folder is a script I made to create a new day from a template, create tests from the clipboard, fetch the input, and automatically run the tests and the program.
The `common` folder contains functions and structs commonly used to solve problems.
